HvZ is a rogue like developed during the 2014 rogue like challenge by Micah Mahlke Workman.
HvZ is based off of the sport/game of Humans vs Zombies, a tag like game played on 
school campuses around the world.
This readme is based on the 1.0 version of the game.

Humans vs Zombies:
The real life game of Humans vs Zombies is an incredibly fun and rewarding game that 
I encourage anyone reading this document to research and play.  The basic gist of the 
game is that there are players who are humans and those who are zombies.  The zombie 
players are trying to tag the human players.  If a human player is tagged then they 
become a zombie.  Humans may defend themselves with nerf blasters, a shot from which 
will knock the zombie out of the game for a few minutes.  These games usually last around a 
week and may have missions and other components to them.  This game is supposed to 
simulate a single day of the full game in which one is merely trying to survive through 
the school day.

Goal:
The goal of this game is to make it to all of your classes and then get off campus 
without getting tagged by zombies or being late to class.  Your class is represented 
by a yellow 'C' located somewhere on the map.  The minimap will show you which building 
your  class is located in, and once you are inside the building you will be able to see 
where exactly the class is located.  After you gone to class, you will have to go to 
the next one.  Once all your classes are completed for the day you must make it back 
to the place where you entered the game, also indicated by a yellow C.  Making it to 
this last yellow C will win you the game.  

Trials:
There are only two things standing in the way of you making it to class.  Zombies and the clock.  
Zombies will chase you and try and tag you, while if you take to long, time will pass and you 
will miss your class.  Move quickly to your class, avoiding or stunning zombies and you will do fine.
Zombies that are stunned will respawn in three minutes time, returning to the game.  
Zombies are represend by an orange 'Z' when active and a blue 'z' when stunned.  Stunned zombies will
try to get out of your way in general.

Tools:
Your nerf gun and your feet are your only two lines of defense against the zombies.  
Currently this game only has one type of nerf gun available.  In order to shoot a 
zombie you must have your nerf gun loaded, the gun must be cocked, and then you must 
fire the gun.  You can store ammo in your gun and also in both pockets.  Each pocket 
can hold up to 20 shots.  Ammo can be recovered after it is shot.

Guns:
	-Maverick-
	The Maverick can hold 6 shots and is a front loaded pistol.  Mavericks are notoriously unreliable 
	and in future versions they will jam but in the current version they never do so.  You cannot 
	load the barrel that is currently primed for firing.  Firing the gun when it is not cocked will 
	cause the barrel to rotate without expending a bullet.

Start Screen:
The game will start with a blurb about Humans vs Zombies.

Name Entry:
After this it will prompt you for your characters name.

Map Options:
After that it will give you some map options.
Map Size: Tiny = 261x261  Small = 461x461  Med = 661x661  Large = 861x861
The game will run much more smoothly with smaller map sizes, though it may not matter depending on your computer.
Zombie Rate: This determines how many zombies there are on the map.  The total number of zombies will increase 
with the size of the map, but the rate per area is controlled with this option.
Ground Ammo:  This determines how much ammo is randomly generated on the ground.  Total based on this number and 
map size.  There will always be a lot more zombies than there is ammo spawned on the map.
Tardy Bell:  Determines the time in minutes that you have between each of your classes.  Each square reprents one
square meter and your movement speed is approximately 2m per second.
Buildings:  This determines how filled your campus is with buildings.  Less buildings mean more open fields.  
Buildings can be red or grey.  There is no mechanical difference between the two, with the one representing 
brick and the other concrete.
Num Classes:  This number represents the number of times you need to go to class before you can leave for the day.

Player Options:
In the next screen you have 10 points to spend on several different options.  You can increase your supply of 
points by decreasing some of your stats as well.
Stamina:  This stat will increase the amount you can run before you get tired as well as increasing how fast you 
recover when allowed time to rest.
Speed:  This stat determines how quickly you move, as well as how fast you can turn.
Accuracy:  You can shoot your gun 3*your accuracy stat squares.
Training:  Also called technical stat, this determines how quickly you can do stuff like reloading your weapon
picking up ammo on the ground etc.  
Gun:  Currently only has one option.  In the future this will be one of your most important choices.
Extra Ammo:  Lets you grab more ammo.  In the future elite ammo will be more effective than Streamline, but 
currently they are exactly the same asside from the color.
Extra Clips:  Some nerf guns use clips.  The Maverick, which is currently your only gun choice, does not.

Game Screen:
The main gain screen has different colors and symbols representing various things.
The @ represents you.
The Z represents a active zombie.
The z represents a stunned zombie.
The C represents either your class or your car.
The ' represents a nerf dart.
Green tiles are grass, blueish-grey is floor.  
Red and Grey are walls and cannot be passed through.
Black is street and also can't be passed through.
Purple represents the zombie that you are currently targetting.
You will only be able to see what is in the direction you are facing with three exceptions.
You can hear running zombies and they will show up even if you are not facing them.
You can see where your class is as long as you are in a building.
You can see the terrain even if you are not looking at it.

Game Menu:
The right had side of the screen is a menu with lots of information.
Your player name and the four stats you picked can be seen in the upper left of the menu area.
In the upper right is the mini map as well as a few different bits of info.
The mini map shows your current location, the location of your next class, and whether there is a building 
in a given area and what color it is.
There are 5 letters next to the mini map that tell you a few different things.
F tells you the direction that your character is facing.
V tells you the direction your character is looking.
L tells you whether you have vision locked to your direction.  If it is locked, then any time your character
changed the direction they are facing, they will look in that same direction.
C tells you how many classes you have left to go to.
S tells you how fast you are moving.  This number can go from 0 to 3 and will be explained in the section on 
running.
Below these stats is the endurance bar.  This represents how much energy you have to spend running.  If the
bar is less than 4 #'s, then you cannot run at full speed.  Being below 2 lowers your max speed further, and 
once the bar is gone completely, then you cannot run at all.
Below this is your gun.  A white line is an empty chamber.  The arrow points to the chamber that will be fired
if you fire the gun.
Bellow this is your two pockets.  The arrow points to the dart that will be loaded into your gun if you load 
your weapon.
Finally, the lowest section is the feed.  Messages from the game will be displayed here.  If you have more 
messages than can be displayed on a single screen then you can scroll up or down.

Running:
Using the run command lets you run.  Running allows you to move more quickly, but it also takes up a
lot of your attention and makes it harder to control exactly where you are going.  
When you are at S = 0, you will have full control of your character, and as soon as your turn comes up,
you will be prompted for an action.
At S = 1, you largely have full contol.  You will automatically move one meter in the direction you are
currently facing after each action.
At S = 2, you lose some control.  You move even faster, but will take several move actions between each
action where you have control.  You will move several squares between each prompting for input.  
At S = 3, there is significant amounts of time in which you are moving without prompt.  You will move even
faster through the squares, but you will likely move around 9 squares before you get a chance to change
directions or take any actions.
When you are running, the forward key will increase your speed and the backwards key will decrease it.  
Running into a wall or a zombie will instantly set your S back to 0 but will cost you some endurance.
The more quickly you move, the faster your endurance depletes.

End Game:
When you are tagged, you run out of time, or you win, the game will pause, and you will be given the chance
to either quit the game or restart it.  You will also be able to see all the zombies around you in the end screen.

Errors:
If the game crashes right after you select your characters stats, try again, but wait in that last
menu a bit longer before finishing up.  After the map settings are selected I start a thread to 
generate the map while you are selecting the characters stats, but if you select them too fast then
the code can try and use the map before it is generated.  Not likely to be an issue unless you are 
spamming enter after selecting a large map.
